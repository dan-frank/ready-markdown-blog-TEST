# Leetcode Questions

Personal archive for answered, unanswered, and failed leetcode and interview questions that I have attempted or want to attempt.

## Usage

The best method to use this archive is with the [archive section](#archive).
Here you can find quick links to my solutions and to the problem itself.
I have included the name of the Leetcode problem so you can easily find it with a search in your browser of choice.

If you hate documentation, you can also navigate to [`src/main/scala`](src/main/scala) and find all of the solutions.

I have written test cases for (most of) the solutions, and these can be found under [`src/test/scala`](src/test/scala/).

The majority of solutions have been resolved with Scala, managed and tested with `sbt` (which also handles Java solutions).
However, a few other languages can be found that cannot be handled by `sbt`; these will need to be run seperately, likely inside the Leetcode editor.

As the archive has been setup with `sbt`, you can use `sbt` commands.
Compile the code with `sbt compile`, test with `sbt test`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

Due to the nature of this project there are no main methods for running the code, and as such `sbt run` won't produce any meaningful results.
If you want to extend this project yourself, I recommend introducing and running more test cases.
